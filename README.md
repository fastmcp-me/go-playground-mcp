## üßô Features

- **Run Go Code**: Execute Go code in the Go Playground sandbox
- **Share Code**: Generate shareable URLs for Go code snippets
- **Run and Share**: Execute code and get both results and share URL in one operation
- **MCP Integration**: Full Model Context Protocol compliance

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

The server can be used with any MCP-compatible client. The server provides three tools:

1. **`run_go_code`** - Execute Go code and return results
2. **`share_go_code`** - Share Go code and get a URL
3. **`run_and_share_go_code`** - Execute code and get both results and share URL

Add this to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "go-playground": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "go-playground-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
